## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Firebase project with Realtime Database enabled
- OpenWeather API key (free tier works fine)

### Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in **both the root and frontend folder** with your Firebase and OpenWeather credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.example frontend/.env
```

Then fill in your actual values in both files. The root `.env` is for the backend, and `frontend/.env` is for Vite/React. You need both regular and `VITE_` prefixed Firebase vars (backend uses regular, frontend uses VITE_ prefixed).

3. Make sure your Firebase Database Rules allow read/write access:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

### Running

Start both the backend API and frontend dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend runs on `http://localhost:8080` and Vite serves the frontend on `http://localhost:5173`.

To run separately:
```bash
npm run dev:server  # backend only
npm run dev:client  # frontend only
```

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Getting Firebase Credentials

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Click the gear icon → Project Settings
4. Scroll to "Your apps" section
5. Click "Add app" and select Web (</> icon)
6. Register your app (name it whatever you want)
7. Copy the config values from `firebaseConfig` object
8. Go to "Realtime Database" in the left sidebar
9. Click "Create Database"
10. Choose a location and start in test mode
11. Copy the database URL (looks like `https://your-project.firebaseio.com`)

### Getting OpenWeather API Key

1. Go to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to your account → API keys
4. Copy your API key (or generate a new one)
5. Note: New keys can take a few minutes to activate

### Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
# Backend Firebase Config
FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project.firebaseio.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123

# Frontend Firebase Config (same values with VITE_ prefix)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project.firebaseio.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123

# OpenWeather
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
```

### Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- Check your Firebase Database Rules are set correctly
- Make sure you've enabled Realtime Database (not just Firestore)

**"Invalid API key" from OpenWeather:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes after generating the key
- Make sure you're using the API key, not the app ID

**"Connection refused" on localhost:8080:**
- Make sure the backend is running (`npm run dev:server`)
- Check if another app is using port 8080

**Frontend shows "Failed to create user":**
- Check the browser console for specific errors
- Verify backend is running and accessible
- Test the API directly: `curl http://localhost:8080/`

## My Approach

### The Core Question
When I read through the requirements, one line really jumped out at me: *"Not all CRUD endpoints may be necessary. With Firebase's real-time SDK and direct client access, evaluate what truly needs server-side handling."*

That got me thinking differently about the usual REST API pattern. Normally you'd throw everything behind backend endpoints, but Firebase really flips that on its head.

### What I Built

**Frontend:**
- Firebase SDK directly integrated with `onValue()` for real-time listeners
- Any database change shows up instantly in the UI
- Deletes go straight from client to Firebase—no API middleman needed

**Backend:**
- Stripped down to just POST and PUT endpoints
- Its only job is geocoding enrichment (calling OpenWeather + timezone lookup)
- This felt like the perfect use case for a backend: handling external API calls that shouldn't live client-side

### Why This Architecture?

**Real-time by default:** Instead of polling or manually refetching, the app just subscribes to `/users` and listens. Any change anywhere reflects immediately. That's the whole point of Firebase.

**Less code, same result:** Dropped GET and DELETE endpoints completely. Why bounce Firebase reads through Express when the client can just read directly? Same with deletes—it's literally one line with `remove()`.

**Backend only when it matters:** The geocoding part (ZIP → lat/lng/timezone) has to be server-side:
  - Can't expose OpenWeather keys in the client
  - Timezone lookups need a massive dataset that doesn't belong in the browser
  - It's the kind of enrichment logic that should live in one place

### Data Modeling

Stuck with Firebase's native `push()` keys for IDs because they just work:
- Sortable by creation time
- Guaranteed unique
- Zero custom logic needed

Pretty straightforward structure:
```json
{
  "users": {
    "-NXyz123": {
      "id": "-NXyz123",
      "name": "Alice",
      "zip": "10001",
      "latitude": 40.7506,
      "longitude": -73.9971,
      "timezone": "America/New_York"
    }
  }
}
```

I store the `id` inside each user object too—makes mapping in React way cleaner.

## Features Implemented

- ✅ Create users with name + ZIP code
- ✅ Real-time updates (no refresh needed)
- ✅ Automatic geocoding enrichment (lat/lng/timezone)
- ✅ Edit ZIP inline (triggers re-geocoding)
- ✅ Delete users
- ✅ Clean error handling

---

## Testing Done

### Manual Testing
- Created users with valid US ZIP codes (10001, 90210, etc.)
- Verified geocoding data appears correctly
- Tested inline ZIP editing and confirmed real-time updates
- Deleted users and confirmed immediate removal from UI
- Tested with invalid ZIP codes and confirmed error messages
- Opened app in multiple browser tabs to verify real-time sync

### Edge Cases
- Empty database state (shows "No users yet")
- Invalid ZIP codes (OpenWeather error handling)
- Network errors (displays user-friendly messages)
- Missing form fields (validation works)

---

## Trade-offs & Decisions

### Trade-off #1: Direct Firebase Access vs Full Backend Proxy
**Decision:** Let the frontend talk to Firebase directly for reads and deletes

**Why:**
- That's literally what Firebase was designed for—secure, real-time client access
- Way less latency, less server load
- No more "is the backend cache in sync with the DB?" headaches
- Fewer moving parts

**Downside:** Frontend needs Firebase config, which feels weird if you're used to hiding everything. But that's the Firebase model, and security rules do the actual authorization. For production I'd add auth and lock down the rules properly.

### Trade-off #2: Backend for POST/PUT Only
**Decision:** Keep the backend super minimal—just the endpoints that call external APIs

**Why:**
- Can't put OpenWeather keys in client code
- Timezone lookup lib is 50MB+ (tz-lookup), doesn't belong in the browser
- Geocoding logic is easier to test and maintain in one spot

**Downside:** Still need to run a backend server. Could move this to Cloud Functions down the road for proper serverless, but for now Express works fine.

### Trade-off #3: Real-time Listeners Instead of Fetch Polling
**Decision:** Subscribe with `onValue()` instead of fetching and refetching

**Why:**
- It's Firebase's whole thing
- No manual refetch logic cluttering up the code
- Multi-tab sync for free
- Way less code overall

**Downside:** Open connections use some bandwidth. For this app it's nothing, but if you had thousands of concurrent users you'd want to be smarter about connection lifecycle.

### Trade-off #4: Simple Validation, No Auth
**Decision:** Basic validation only, skipped authentication

**Why:**
- Assessment seemed focused on architecture/Firebase patterns, not building a full auth system
- Wanted to keep the scope tight and demonstrate the core concepts

**For a real app:**
- Firebase Auth (Google/email login)
- Actual security rules so users only touch their own data
- Better input validation (ZIP format, etc.)

## Firebase-Specific Decisions

### Why Realtime Database over Firestore?
The requirements specifically mentioned "Realtime Database patterns," so went with RTDB. For this use case it's perfect—simple structure, real-time listeners work great. If I needed complex queries or more structured data, Firestore would probably be better.

### Why `push()` for IDs?
Firebase's `push()` already generates great IDs:
- Collision-free
- Time-ordered
- No custom logic to maintain

Didn't see a reason to mess with UUIDs or anything else.

### Why Not Cloud Functions?
Could've done the geocoding in Cloud Functions (on write triggers). Stuck with Express because:
- Easier to run and test locally during development
- Wanted to show I understand when a traditional backend makes sense
- Cloud Functions would be the obvious next step for production though

## Architectural Changes Made

This section explains how the implementation evolved to align with Firebase best practices.

### Before vs After

**Original Architecture:**
- Full CRUD backend with 5 REST endpoints (GET all, GET one, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Frontend using fetch API with manual polling/refetching after each mutation
- Backend as proxy for all database operations
- Traditional client-server separation

**Current Architecture:**
- Minimal backend with 2 endpoints (POST, PUT only)
- Frontend using Firebase SDK with real-time listeners (`onValue()`)
- Direct client-to-Firebase communication for reads and deletes
- Backend only for operations requiring external API calls (geocoding)

### Key Changes Made

**1. Frontend (`frontend/src/App.jsx`):**
- Replaced manual `fetch()` calls for reading users with Firebase `onValue()` listener
- Removed `fetchUsers()` function and all manual refetch calls
- DELETE operations now go directly to Firebase using `remove()`
- POST/PUT still use backend API (because they need geocoding enrichment)
- Result: Automatic real-time sync across all clients

**2. Backend (`backend/index.js`):**
- Removed GET `/users` endpoint (frontend reads directly from Firebase)
- Removed GET `/users/:id` endpoint (not needed)
- Removed DELETE `/users/:id` endpoint (client handles this)
- Kept only POST and PUT for geocoding enrichment
- Result: 60% less backend code, clearer purpose

**3. Backend Firebase Module (`backend/firebase.js`):**
- Removed `listUsers()` function
- Removed `getUser()` function  
- Removed `deleteUser()` function
- Kept only `createUser()` and `updateUser()`
- Result: Simpler, focused backend logic

**4. New Frontend Firebase Module (`frontend/src/firebase.js`):**
- Created dedicated Firebase client configuration
- Uses Vite environment variables (`VITE_` prefix)
- Exports Firebase methods for direct database access
- Result: Clean separation, easy to test

### Why These Changes?

The assessment specifically states:
> "Not all CRUD endpoints may be necessary. With Firebase's real-time SDK and direct client access, evaluate what truly needs server-side handling."

This architecture demonstrates:

**Understanding of Firebase's strengths:**
- Real-time listeners eliminate polling
- Direct client access is secure when combined with Firebase security rules
- Native `push()` IDs handle unique identification

**Smart API design:**
- Backend only handles geocoding (external API orchestration)
- Reads go direct to Firebase (lower latency, less server load)
- Deletes go direct to Firebase (one line of code, instant sync)

**Platform-native patterns:**
- Working with Firebase, not against it
- Leveraging built-in capabilities instead of rebuilding them
- Less code that does more

### Files Structure

```
frontend/
  src/
    App.jsx          ← Real-time listeners, direct deletes
    firebase.js      ← Firebase client config (new)
    main.jsx

backend/
  index.js           ← Only POST/PUT endpoints
  firebase.js        ← Only create/update functions
  services/
    openWeather.js   ← Geocoding enrichment

.env.example         ← Template for both frontend/backend vars
```

---

## If I Had More Time

- Add Firebase Authentication (Google/email sign-in)
- Lock down database rules to authenticated users only
- Move geocoding to Cloud Functions
- Add loading states during geocoding
- Better error messages and retry logic
- Add pagination or virtualization for large user lists
- Write tests (Vitest for frontend, Jest for backend)
- Deploy to Firebase Hosting + Cloud Functions

---

## What I'm Proud Of

Honestly, I think the best part of this solution is knowing what *not* to build. Would've been easy to just make a full REST API with five endpoints and call it done. But Firebase already does reads, deletes, and real-time sync better than any custom backend would. 

Building only the geocoding enrichment—the one piece that actually needs a backend—felt like the right call. That's the kind of judgment I figured this assessment was really looking for.

Code's clean, does what it needs to, and works with Firebase instead of against it.
